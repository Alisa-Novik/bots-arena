This is so stupid that bots are recreated in bots array even in one generation. 
This is a bug. It should be fixed.

- CLI-based Control panel (pause, speed, generation config) 
- Floating UI for bot info
- UI refactoring -> colors
- Farms, mine, colletors
- Give bots Memory? Communication?

Bugs:
1. Bots can walk into farms and/or food ?
2. Bots can stuck in grabloop around foodfarm.
This is because pointer jumps ending up in to be the same set of positions. 
I decided that this is not somthing I want to fix, but rather let evolution handle it.
