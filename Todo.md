- CLI-based Control panel (pause, speed, generation config) 
- Floating UI for bot info
- UI refactoring -> colors
- Farms, mine, colletors
- Give bots Memory? Communication?

Ideas for controller tasks
1) find water; 
2) build Mine; 
3) find other colonies; 
4) build wall;
5) 
__
1) Colony should be able to issue high level tasks like "form a connection"
2) Whenever colony (opens Water as a resource?) has connection to a Water
it should be able to build special type of building which is "Windmill" that allows
to recycle extra bots into inventory amount.
3) It should maintain connection to both water and Windmill to maintain benefits.
4) Whenever colony has a Windmill and water it can build Mine and issue "mine" tasks within limit.
It will either decide to assign owners to the task or bots will pick it up on their turn.
Water + Resources -> Farms
